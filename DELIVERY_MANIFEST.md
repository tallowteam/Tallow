## Key Documentation Principles

### 1. Clarity
Every agent's role is crystal clear:
- What they own (Scope of Authority)
- What they must deliver (Deliverables)
- How they must perform (Quality Standards)
- What happens if they fail (Failure Impact)

### 2. Accountability
Explicit ownership prevents finger-pointing:
- Each agent has specific deliverables
- Quality standards are measurable
- Failure impacts quantified
- Operational rules are non-negotiable

### 3. Interconnection
No agent operates in isolation:
- Inter-agent dependencies mapped
- Failure cascades identified
- Coordination requirements clear
- Cross-team handoffs explicit

### 4. Actionability
Documentation drives action:
- Deliverables checklist (what to build)
- Quality standards (how to test)
- Operational rules (what not to do)
- Success metrics (how to measure)
