# Release Signoffs

Each release tag must include a matching signoff file at:

- `release-signoffs/<tag>.json` (for example, `release-signoffs/v1.2.3.json`)

The release workflow validates this file before publishing release artifacts.

Required approvers:

- `002` (CIPHER)
- `019` (CRYPTO-AUDITOR)
- `078` (SECURITY-PENETRATOR)
- `075` (DC-GOLF)
- `086` (DC-HOTEL)
- `001` (RAMSAD)

Use `release-signoffs/TEMPLATE.json` as the schema and replace all placeholder values.
