### Ralph orchestrator baseline files exist
- policy, orchestrator script, and workflow files found

### Overnight loop, circuit breaker, progress cadence, and DONE output are implemented
- orchestrator encodes overnight run loop semantics with progress and circuit breaker controls

### Crypto modifications are blocked without CIPHER sign-off

### Sign-off artifacts include CIPHER approver
- release-signoffs/v0.1.0.json => no-cipher-approval
- release-signoffs/TEMPLATE.json => no-cipher-approval
- no artifact contained an approved/signed CIPHER entry (approverId 002)

### Ralph policy is documented and actionable
