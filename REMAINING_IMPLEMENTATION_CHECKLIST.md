- [x] Started execution across remaining checklist work using the team-based structure.
- [x] Ran core production gates: `verify:features:json`, `type-check`, `lint`, and `test:unit`.
- [x] Generated feature verification report: `reports/verification-2026-02-08.json` (29/49 verified, 20 partial, 59.2% rate).
- [x] Generated unit test report: `reports/vitest-unit.json` (613 suites total, 163 failing; 1590 tests total, 203 failing).
- [x] Captured lint report: `reports/lint-2026-02-08.txt` (438 errors, 2560 warnings).
- [x] Captured type-check reports and started fixes: `reports/typecheck-2026-02-08.txt`, `reports/typecheck-after-second-fix.txt`.
- [x] Implemented barrel export cleanup in `lib/network/index.ts` and `lib/transfer/index.ts`; type-check errors reduced from 372 to 291.
- [x] Merged autonomous strategy checklist into this file as section `F` to keep one canonical checklist.
- [x] Started an additional type-check remediation pass and applied targeted fixes in `lib/workers/worker-bridge.ts`, `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, `lib/payments/stripe-service.ts`, `lib/payments/subscription-store.ts`, and `app/api/contacts/route.ts`.
- [x] Re-ran `npm run type-check` to collect current live blocker set for next burn-down batch.
- [x] Completed type-check burn-down: `npm run type-check` now exits `0` with no TypeScript errors. [evidence: terminal run, 2026-02-08, `npm run type-check`]
- [x] Re-ran strict feature verification and regenerated artifacts: `reports/verification-2026-02-08.json`, `reports/verification-2026-02-08.md`, `reports/verification-2026-02-08.html` (29/49 verified, 20 partial, 59.2%).
- [x] Re-ran lint gate with strict warnings policy and captured live blocker count: `389 errors`, `2572 warnings` from `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0`.
- [x] Ran `npm run lint -- --fix` in unrestricted mode and reduced lint blockers to `93 errors`, `2571 warnings`.
- [x] Re-ran `npm run type-check` after lint auto-fixes; compile gate remains green with `0` TypeScript errors.
