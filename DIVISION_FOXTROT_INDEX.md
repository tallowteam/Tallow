|------|-----------|
| **Feature Parity** | All platforms support same core features (send, receive, P2P, relay, encryption) |
| **Native Feel** | App uses OS-specific UI patterns + performance optimizations per platform |
| **P2P** | Peer-to-peer direct transfer (WebRTC on mobile/web, native socket on desktop) |
| **Relay** | Fallback server when P2P fails (encrypted E2E, server never sees plaintext) |
| **PAKE** | Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (code phrase derivation) |
| **ML-KEM-768** | Post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (replaces RSA) |
| **E2E Encryption** | End-to-End encryption (only sender/receiver decrypt, relay can't) |
| **SAS** | Short Authentication String (emoji matching for MITM prevention) |
| **FFI** | Foreign Function Interface (calling Rust crypto from platform code) |
| **Staged Rollout** | Gradual release to 5%, 25%, 100% over 1 week (catch bugs early) |

## QUICK DECISION REFERENCE

**What platform to develop?**
- Mobile → Agents 062-063 (iOS/Android specialists)
- Desktop → Agents 064, 068 (desktop + Electron)
- CLI → Agent 065 (Go CLI tool)
- Web/PWA → Agent 066
- Extension → Agent 067
- Cross-platform base → Agent 061 (Flutter)

**What feature set to implement?**
- Core (all platforms) → see feature parity checklist
- iOS-only → read Agent 062 section
- Android-only → read Agent 063 section
- Desktop-only → read Agents 064, 068 sections
- Advanced (NFC, QR, clipboard, etc.) → Agents 070-074

**What to prioritize?**
1. Security (CIPHER + CRYPTO-AUDITOR sign-off required)
2. Feature parity (must work on all platforms)
3. Native performance (60fps, <200ms latency)
4. User privacy (no tracking, zero data retention)
