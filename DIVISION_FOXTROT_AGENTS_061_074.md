## CRITICAL DEPENDENCY CHAINS

**Crypto Flow**:
CRYPTO-AUDITOR (019) → FLUTTER-COMMANDER (061 FFI) → Platform-specific crypto (062/063/064/065)

**Security Flow**:
SECURITY-PENETRATOR (078) → Platform specialists (062/063/064/065) → Release approval

**Quality Flow**:
E2E-INFILTRATOR (077) → COMPATIBILITY-SCOUT (082) → PERFORMANCE-PROFILER (081) → Release

**Distribution Flow**:
ELECTRON-ARCHITECT (068) → CI-CD-PIPELINE-MASTER (088) → Platform stores (App Store, Play Store, etc.)

## FAILURE SCENARIOS & MITIGATIONS

### P0 (Critical)
- **Crypto FFI breaks**: Crypto-auditor reviews every change, KAT tests catch
- **Share Extension crashes**: Separate process isolation, TestFlight beta
- **Auto-updater fails**: Staged rollout (5%, 25%, 100%), rollback on >0.1% crash
- **Context menu malware**: Code signing, Windows Defender whitelist

### P1 (High)
- **Platform API deprecation**: 6-month advance tracking, 30-day remediation
- **Battery drain >5%**: Profiling on real devices, WorkManager tuning
- **Feature parity gap**: Automated feature matrix, cross-platform tests
- **App store rejection**: Beta testing, store guideline review

### P2 (Medium)
- **Widget performance slow**: Reduce update frequency, battery saver mode
- **BLE discovery slow**: Fast scan interval, timeout after 5s
- **Compression breaks data**: Verify BLAKE3 hash before/after
