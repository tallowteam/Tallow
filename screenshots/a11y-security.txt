  - heading "Post-Quantum Protection" [level=2]
  - paragraph: Quantum computers will break today's encryption. We're already protected with NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography.
  - heading "Why post-quantum?" [level=4]
  - paragraph: Modern encryption relies on mathematical problems that are hard for classical computers to solve. Quantum computers can solve these problems exponentially faster, rendering traditional encryption obsolete.
  - paragraph: ML-KEM (formerly Kyber) is based on lattice cryptography, which is believed to be resistant to both classical and quantum attacks.
